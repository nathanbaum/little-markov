* I argue, however, that buta has no fixed meaning, which is its most valuable asset. ~ * The earliest samples of buta date back to the persian empire in Iran. ~ * Scholars believe that the symbolism of the shape is meant to represent a bent cypress tree, a plant which held religious significance to practitioners of the zoroastrian religion common in that time and place. ~ * However, no written records exist to confirm this theory. ~ * In practice, the buta has been repurposed to serve many different symbolic meanings over its thousand-year tenure. ~ * In some manifestations it has represented a mango, a fig leaf, a flower, and sometimes even complex geopolitical relationships. ~ * Chitralekha Zutshi writes that "In Mughal and later British India, for instance, Kashmiri shawls were not only used as primarily male shoulder mantles but also as khillat, or royal gifts of cloth through which a complex set of meanings were literally transferred between the royal patron and gift recipient." ~ * (Zutshi, Chitralekha 2009: 423) For thousands of years before the British colonized India, a thriving buta shawl trade existed with Kashmir at the center. ~ * A city dominated by its textile industry, almost all the shawls created were bound for export. ~ * Because it could take an expert craftsman 12-16 months to finish one shawl, only royalty could afford to buy the garments. ~ * The most common use of a shawl was as a gift from political leaders to their civil servants, or from one leader to another. ~ * Consequently, instead of the shawls possessing some religious or spiritual meaning, patrons often commissioned shawls to be created with messages embroidered on them to commemorate political relationships. ~ * So it is more accurate to think of buta as a template than a symbol or object. ~ * This flexibility allowed buta to pass seamlessly from culture to culture, picking up new meaning at every stop. ~
